### Description
This is a small Unity game that I did, just to prove that I can do something without any tutorial. It's basically a Flappy Bird clone with a little twist, the obstacles are rotating making the game more interesting.
***
### What I learned
* Coroutine
#
I made the "Obstacles Generator" with Coroutine, at the beginning of the game the coroutine is started and generates an obstacle and the same coroutine is started as a loop.
* PlayerPrefab
#
When the player gets his highest score, that score is stored in the PlayerPrefs to in high score text
